# Bold Time
Like the name says. This is a watchface designed to use up as much real estate as possible displaying the time. Colors and spacing can be edited by the user.

## Details
The watchface simulates a 3x5 cell font, and dynamically adapts the sizes of those cells to not only fill all available space (given the dimensions of the screen) but also to do so completely symmetrically.
